            About Me
          </h1>
          <p>
            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Balabhadra</span>, a
            passionate and curious tech enthusiast currently pursuing my B.Tech in
            Computer Science &amp; Engineering at OUTR, Bhubaneswar. My journey into
            technology began with a simple curiosity about how websites and apps
            work, and over time, itâ€™s grown into a full-fledged passion for building
            impactful digital solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in full-stack web development, blending creativity with
            technical precision to craft seamless and user-friendly experiences.
            Whether itâ€™s writing clean, efficient code, designing intuitive
            interfaces, or exploring the latest frameworks, Iâ€™m always looking for
            ways to push boundaries and improve my craft. Alongside development, Iâ€™m
            deeply interested in problem-solving, constantly honing my skills through
            competitive programming and logical challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            My philosophy is simple: <span className="italic">Learn, Build, Evolve</span>.
            I believe in continuous growth â€” adapting to new technologies, embracing
            challenges, and contributing to meaningful projects. Outside of coding,
            I enjoy exploring design trends, collaborating with like-minded people,
            and staying inspired by the ever-changing tech landscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            If youâ€™re as excited about innovation as I am, letâ€™s connect and create
            something remarkable together!
